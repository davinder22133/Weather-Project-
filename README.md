# Weather-Project-
In this project i am building the weather prediction application using python and its different modules. 
I also connect the weather prediction application to the sql database. So that user can save the weather information about any particular country, city etc. in a database.
I also add the feature like dark mode and white mode in this project.
I also add the warning feature so that if any country, city has chances of heavy rainfall so it can alert us before it happening.
